Product Requirements Document: Onchain Credit Score Builder Loans
Executive Summary
Product Vision
An innovative decentralized platform that helps individuals build verifiable credit histories on the blockchain through structured credit builder loans, creating financial inclusion for the underbanked while generating sustainable revenue through various service fees and marketplace opportunities.
Problem Statement
Over 1.7 billion adults worldwide lack access to financial services due to missing credit histories. Traditional credit scoring systems are opaque, centralized, and inaccessible to many. This creates a paradoxical barrier: without credit history, individuals cannot access loans; without loans, they cannot build credit history.
Solution Overview
Our platform solves this problem by creating a transparent, blockchain-based credit building system where users can establish verifiable financial reputations through a structured process:
Deposit collateral into a smart contract
Make regular payments over time
Build a transparent credit history
Access progressively better financial opportunities
User Journey & Core Process
1 User Registration
Users connect their blockchain wallet
Complete basic KYC verification (adjustable based on regulatory requirements)
Review and accept platform terms
2 Credit Builder Loan Process
The credit building process follows these exact steps:
Step 1: Collateral Deposit
User deposits a specific amount (e.g., $100 in stablecoins) into a smart contract
This collateral is locked for the duration of the credit building period
The deposit amount determines the loan amount (typically 1:1 ratio)
Step 2: Loan Creation
A smart contract automatically creates a "credit builder loan" equal to the collateral amount
Example: $100 loan with 8% APR over 12 months
Monthly payment calculated: approximately $8.67 per month
Payment schedule is established and visible to the user
Step 3: Payment Process
User makes monthly payments of $8.67 for 12 months (total: ~$104)
Each payment consists of principal repayment plus interest
Payments are made directly from the user's wallet to the smart contract
Each payment is recorded on the blockchain as a verifiable transaction
On-time payments positively impact the user's credit score
Late/missed payments negatively impact the credit score and may incur penalties
Step 4: Loan Completion
After all payments are made (12 monthly payments totaling ~$104)
The smart contract returns the original $100 collateral to the user's wallet
The platform retains the interest portion (~$4) as revenue
User receives final credit score and completed loan certificate (NFT)
